# Park App

Park App is a web app built with Python and Flask that is designed to predict and display the availability of parking in Downtown Melbourne Australia.


## Motivation
Park App is motivated by the desire to spend more time walking around a city and less driving around a city looking for parking. It is a full-stack machine learning project that was built during the SharpestMinds mentorship program.
